# Scenario
Our cat, Gado, has been kidnapped. The kidnapper has sent us a document with their requests in MS Word Document format. We have converted the document to PDF format and extracted the image from the MS Word file for your convenience.

You can download the attached file below to your local machine for inspection. 

## Process
As we have a doc file from the kidnapper. We can get usefull information by analyzing that doc file.
To analyze it write 
```
pdfinfo
```
Pdfinfo displays various metadata related to a PDF file, such as title, subject, author, creator, and creation date. 

If you don't have pdfinfo installed, you can install it using 
``` 
sudo apt install poppler-utils 
```
